This ebike motor controller firmware project is to be used with the Tongsheng TSDZ2 mid drive motor.

It has the following benefits compared to the stock firmware:
* The motor runs more efficient therefore it becomes more powerful and consumes less energy.
* The ebike will feel more responsive and agile.
* Using other supported displays and pheriperals will provide more functionality and features. Because this project is in heavy development more features will be added.

This project is being developed and maintained for free by a community of users. Some of them are developers who work professionally developing this type of technology for very well known companies.
